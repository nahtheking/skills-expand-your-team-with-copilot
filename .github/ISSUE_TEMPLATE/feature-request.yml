        ## Implementation Notes for Developer
        **Analysis Required:**
        - Evaluate technical feasibility and complexity
        - Consider impact on existing codebase
        - Identify database schema changes needed
        - Plan user interface modifications

        **Key Considerations:**
        - User authentication and permissions
        - Data validation and error handling
        - Mobile responsiveness
        - Performance impact
        - Security implications

        **Files Likely to Change:**
        - Frontend: `src/static/app.js`, `src/static/index.html`
        - Backend: `src/backend/routers/` (new endpoints)
        - Database: `src/backend/database.py` (schema updates)

        **Testing Requirements:**
        - Unit tests for new functionality
        - Integration tests with existing features
        - User experience testing
        - Performance testing if applicable
